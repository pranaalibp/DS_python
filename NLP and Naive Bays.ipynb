    "\n",
    "#### 1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tLoad the \"blogs_categories.csv\" dataset and perform an exploratory data analysis to understand its structure and content.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tPreprocess the data by cleaning the text (removing punctuation, converting to lowercase, etc.), tokenizing, and removing stopwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tPerform feature extraction to convert text data into a format that can be used by the Naive Bayes model, using techniques such as TF-IDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Naive Bayes Model for Text Classification -\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tSplit the data into training and test sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tImplement a Naive Bayes classifier to categorize the blog posts into their respective categories. You can use libraries like scikit-learn for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tTrain the model on the training set and make predictions on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Sentiment Analysis -\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tChoose a suitable library or method for performing sentiment analysis on the blog post texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tAnalyze the sentiments expressed in the blog posts and categorize them as positive, negative, or neutral. Consider only the Data column and get the sentiment for each blog.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tExamine the distribution of sentiments across different categories and summarize your findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Evaluation -\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tEvaluate the performance of your Naive Bayes classifier using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tDiscuss the performance of the model and any challenges encountered during the classification process.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tReflect on the sentiment analysis results and their implications regarding the content of the blog posts.\n"
